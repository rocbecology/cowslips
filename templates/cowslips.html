    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>

With over 100 million verified observations on iNaturalist, community science datasets represent a unique window into life on earth. Many of these observations are accompanied by pictures - taken by anyone, anywhere, and verified by other iNaturalist users online. However, these pictures can contain much more information than simply species identification. Many morphological features, varying between individuals of the same species, can be quickly and easily assessed from photographs. For example, we might ask questions like: 
<br> * can you see mites on this bumblebee? 
<br> * are any of the woodlice in this photograph blue? 
<br> * which type of stamen does this cowslip have? 
<br> This website seeks to get citizen scientists to look closely at photographs, to answer simple questions such as these. With the data generated, researchers may be to explore spacial and temporal variations in characteristics such as colour changes, parasite load, and balance between morphotypes using iNaturalist photographs.
<p>
For example, this website pulls images of Cowslips, taken by iNaturalist users in West Yorkshire, and asks users to identify if the flowers are S-morphs, L-morphs or if the stamen is not visible. 
  Responses are then stored in an online database, containing the location, time and date of the observation, along with the proportion of users that have identified a particular stamen type in the image.
<br> Cowslips are heteromorphic: they have two possible flower forms, either short (s-morph), with the stamen being easy to spot, or long (l-morph) with only the stigma visible (see diagram below).
  In order to produce seeds, an S-morph cowslip must be pollinated by L-morphs and vice versa. This system, which was of great interest to Charles Darwin [link], prevents self pollination and encourages genetic exchange between plants. In this way, a balance between the two types is essential to maintain a viable cowslip population, while an overabundance of one particular type could indicate a population in decline. 
  <br> Can you see which type is displayed in the image above?

<u>How can I join in?</u>
<p>
Simply take a minute to study the photograph. Using the key below, determine if the largest flower in the image is of S type, L type, or if the stamen is not visible. Make your selection and click submit. You may occassionally see images that are poor quality, obscured, or even of the wrong species. For these you can also select "not visible". </p>
