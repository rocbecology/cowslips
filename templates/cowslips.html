    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>

With over 100 million verified observations on iNaturalist, community science datasets represent a unique window into life on earth. Many of these observations are accompanied by pictures - taken by anyone, anywhere, and verified by other iNaturalist users online. However, these pictures can contain much more information than simply species identification. Many morphological features, varying between individuals of the same species, can be quickly and easily assessed from photographs. For example, we might ask questions like: 
<br> * can you see mites on this bumblebee? 
<br> * are any of the woodlice in this photograph blue? 
<br> * which type of stamen does this cowslip have? 
<br> This website seeks to get citizen scientists to look closely at photographs, to answer simple questions such as these. With the data generated, researchers may be to explore spacial and temporal variations in characteristics such as colour changes, parasite load, and balance between morphotypes using iNaturalist photographs.
<p>
For example, this website pulls images of Cowslips, taken by iNaturalist users in West Yorkshire, and asks users to identify if the flowers are S-morphs, L-morphs or if the stamen is not visible. Responses are then stored in an online database, containing the location, time and date of the observation, along with the proportion of users that have identified a particular stamen type in the image. Eventually users will be able to login and gain points to make things a little more fun.

iNaturalist data has been used in more than 3000 published papers, some of which have used image background, or other image features to gain interesting ecological insights. For example, Forti et al. (2022) used features in the background of iNaturalist images to assess how climate change may be affecting amphibian refuge preference, while Douch and Poupa (2021) were able to use iNaturalist images to identify the first case of invertebrate iridescent virus 31 in Australia. Another paper, by Hantak et al. (2022) examined 8000 images of Pantherophis ratsnakes to examine if climate predicts color variation, finding support for the thermal melanism hypothesis in the species. The puzzle game Foldit (Cooper et al. 2010) used human visual problem solving, integrated into an online game, to help predict protein structures.

<u>How can I join in?</u>
<p>
Simply take a minute to study the photograph. Using the key below, determine if the largest flower in the image is of S type, L type, or if the stamen is not visible. Make your selection and click submit. You may occassionally see images that are poor quality, obscured, or even of the wrong species. For these you can also select "not visible". </p>
